    /**
     * Particle manager for managing a list of effects and all the emitters and particles they contain
     * <p>The particle manger is the main type you can use to easily manage all of the effects you want to use in your application. It will automatically update 
     * all of the effects and draw the particles with a simple call to #Update and #DrawParticles.</p>
     * <p>The simplest use of the particle manager would be to, create it, add an effect and then update and draw in your main loop:</p>
     * &{<pre>
     * EffectsLibrary* myEffectsLib = EffectsLibrary::LoadEffects("MyEffects.eff");
     * Effect* myEffect = myEffectsLib->GetEffect("Explosion");
     * ParticleManager* myParticleManager = ParticleManager::Create();
     * myParticleManager->SetScreenSize(GraphicsWidth(),GraphicsHeight());
     * myParticleManager->AddEffect(myEffect)
     * while(forever) {
     *     ClearScreen();
     *     myParticleManager->Update();
     *     myParticleManager->DrawParticles();
     *     FlipScreenBuffers();
     * }</pre>
     * }
     * <p>The particle manager maintains 2 lists of particles, an Inuse list for particles currently in the rendering pipeline and an UnUsed list for a pool of particles
     * that can be used by emitters at any time. You can control the maximum number of particles a particle manager can use when you create it:</p>
     * &{
     * int maximumParticles = 2500;
     * ParticleManager* myParticleManager = ParticleManager::CreateParticleManager(maximumParticles);
     * }
     * <p>When emitters need to spawn new particles they will try and grab the next available particle in the Unused list.</p>
     * <p>The command #SetScreenSize tells the particle manager the size of the viewport currently being rendered to. With this information it locates the center of the
     * screen. This is important because the effects do not locate themselves using screen coordinates, they instead use an abritrary set of world coordinates. So if you 
     * place an effect at the coordinates 0,0 it will be drawn at the center of the screen. But don't worry, if you want to use screen coordinates to place your
     * effects you can use the #SetOrigin command to offset the world coordinates to screen space:</p>
     * &{
     * myParticleManager->SetScreenSize(GraphicsWidth(),GraphicsHeight());
     * myParticleManager->SetOrigin(GraphicsWidth()/2,GraphicsHeight()/2);
     * }
     * <p>This will place the origin at the top-left of the viewport so effects placed at 0,0 now will be drawn in the top-left corner of the screen in the same way DrawImage
     * would. If however you application uses it's own world coordinate system to position entities then it should be easy to use #SetOrigin to synchronize the location of any 
     * effects with your app.</p>
     * <p>You can now also define a number of effect layers when creating a particle manager. This enables you to control more easily the order
     * in which effects are drawn. For example, if you create a particle manager with 10 layers, when you use #AddEffect you can specify
     * which layer the effect is added to. Effects on layers 1 will draw on top of layers on layer 0, 2 over 1 etc. The layer index starts from 0, 
     * so if you create 10 layers, their index will range from 0 to 9.</p>
